<h2>Code of Conduct</h2>
<p>
Software Carpentry and TGAC are committed to ensuring a safe and accessible learning environment for all attendees of all backgrounds. Participants are therefore required to abide by Software Carpentry's <a href="http://software-carpentry.org/conduct.html">Code of Conduct</a>.
</p>

<h2>Requirements</h2>
<p>
You will need to bring a laptop with some required software already installed in order to attend the bootcamp. <strong>Please let us know as soon as possible if you are not able to bring your own laptop.</strong><br/><br/>
The easiest way to get set up with the prerequisites for the bootcamp is to install the preconfigured virtual machine (VM). This VM contains the Linux operating system and all the software needed. As such, we suggest that participants bring their laptop with <a href="http://www.nomachine.com">NoMachine</a> installed.
<br/><br/>
If you are confident to install the requirements on your own laptop, please follow the setup directions below.

<!--
  Uncomment this section if you are using our virtual machine.
<div id="vm">
  <h3>Virtual Machine</h3>
  <p>
    Some instructors prefer to have learners use a virtual machine (VM)
    rather than install software on their own computers.  If your
    instructors have chosen to do this, please:
  </p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      Install <a href="https://www.virtualbox.org/">VirtualBox</a>.
    </li>
    <li>
      Download our <a href="{{site.swc_vm}}">VM image</a>.
      <strong>Warning:</strong> this file is 1.7 GByte, so please
      download it <em>before</em> coming to your workshop.
    </li>
    <li>
      Load the VM into VirtualBox by selecting "Import Appliance" and
      loading the <code>.ova</code> file.
    </li>
  </ol>
</div>
-->

</p>

<h2 id="setup">Setup</h2>
<p>
  To participate in a Software Carpentry workshop, you will need
  access to the software described below. In addition, you will
  need an up-to-date web browser.
</p>
<p>
  We maintain a list of common issues that occur during installation as a reference for instructors
  that may be useful on the
  <a href = "https://github.com/swcarpentry/workshop-template/wiki/Configuration-Problems-and-Solutions">Configuration Problems and Solutions wiki page</a>.
</p>

<div id="shell"> <!-- Start of 'shell' section. -->
  <h3>The Bash Shell</h3>

  <p>
    Bash is a commonly-used shell that gives you the power to do simple
    tasks more quickly.
  </p>

  <div class="row">
    <div class="col-md-4">
      <h4 id="shell-windows">Windows</h4>
      <p>
        Download the Git for Windows
	<a href="https://git-for-windows.github.io/">installer</a>. Run the
        installer. <strong>Important: on the 6th page of the installation wizard (the
        page titled `Configuring the terminal emulator...`) select `Use Windows'
        default console window`. If you forgot to do this programs that you need
        for the workshop will not work properly. If this happens rerun the
        installer and select the appropriate option.</strong> This will provide you
        with both Git and Bash in the Git Bash program.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="col-md-4">
      <h4 id="shell-macosx">Mac OS X</h4>
      <p>
        The default shell in all versions of Mac OS X is bash, so no
        need to install anything.  You access bash from the Terminal
        (found in
        <code>/Applications/Utilities</code>).  You may want to keep
        Terminal in your dock for this workshop.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="col-md-4">
      <h4 id="shell-linux">Linux</h4>
      <p>
        The default shell is usually Bash, but if your
        machine is set up differently you can run it by opening a
        terminal and typing <code>bash</code>.  There is no need to
        install anything.

<div id='git'> <!-- Start of 'Git' section. GitHub browser compatability
           is given at https://help.github.com/articles/supported-browsers/-->
  <h3>Git</h3>

  <p>
    Git is a version control system that lets you track who made changes
    to what when and has options for easily updating a shared or public
    version of your code
    on <a href="https://github.com/">github.com</a>. You will need a
    <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/supported-browsers/">supported</a>
    web browser (current versions of Chrome, Firefox or Safari,
    or Internet Explorer version 9 or above).
  </p>

  <div class="row">
    <div class="col-md-4">
      <h4 id="git-windows">Windows</h4>
      <p>
        Git should be installed on your computer as part of your Bash
        install (described above).
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="col-md-4">
      <h4 id="git-macosx">Mac OS X</h4>
      <p>
        <strong>For OS X 10.9 and higher</strong>, install Git for Mac
        by downloading and running the most recent "mavericks" installer from
        <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/git-osx-installer/files/">this list</a>.
        After installing Git, there will not be anything in your <code>/Applications</code> folder,
        as Git is a command line program.
        <strong>For older versions of OS X (10.5-10.8)</strong> use the
        most recent available installer labelled "snow-leopard"
        <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/git-osx-installer/files/">available here</a>.

    <div class="col-md-4">
      <h4 id="git-linux">Linux</h4>
      <p>
        If Git is not already available on your machine you can try to
        install it via your distro's package manager. For Debian/Ubuntu run
        <code>sudo apt-get install git</code> and for Fedora run
        <code>sudo yum install git</code>.

  <h3>Text Editor</h3>

  <p>
    When you're writing code, it's nice to have a text editor that is
    optimized for writing code, with features like automatic
    color-coding of key words.  The default text editor on Mac OS X and
    Linux is usually set to Vim, which is not famous for being
    intuitive.  if you accidentally find yourself stuck in it, try
    typing the escape key, followed by <code>:q!</code> (colon, lower-case 'q',
    exclamation mark), then hitting Return to return to the shell.

        nano is a basic editor and the default that instructors use in the workshop.
        To install it, 
        download the <a href="{{site.swc_installer}}">Software Carpentry Windows installer</a>

  <h3>Python</h3>

  <p>
    <a href="http://python.org">Python</a> is a popular language for
    scientific computing, and great for general-purpose programming as
    well.  Installing all of its scientific packages individually can be
    a bit difficult, so we recommend
    <a href="https://store.continuum.io/cshop/anaconda/">Anaconda</a>,
    an all-in-one installer.
  </p>

    <p>
      Regardless of how you choose to install it,
      <strong>please make sure you install Python version 3.x</strong>
      (e.g., 3.4 is fine).
    </p>

    <p>
      We will teach Python using the IPython notebook, a programming environment
      that runs in a web browser. For this to work you will need a reasonably
      up-to-date browser. The current versions of the Chrome, Safari and
      Firefox browsers are all <a
      href='http://ipython.org/ipython-doc/2/install/install.html#browser-compatibility'>supported</a>
      (some older browsers, including Internet Explorer version 9
      and below, are not).

        <li>
          Press enter. You will follow the text-only prompts.  When
          there is a colon at the bottom of the screen press the down
          arrow to move down through the text. Type <code>yes</code> and
          press enter to approve the license. Press enter to approve the
          default location for the files. Type <code>yes</code> and
          press enter to prepend Anaconda to your <code>PATH</code>
